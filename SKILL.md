# Image Bomb

Design a compelling visual action that forces media coverage of an issue without requiring budget or platform access.

---

## When to Use

- Need media attention for a cause with no advertising budget
- Traditional press releases are being ignored
- User says "Help me create a media moment" or "How do I get coverage with no budget?"
- Want to communicate a complex message through a single striking image
- Seeking to challenge an institution, policy, or idea through symbolic action

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| target | Yes | Institution, policy, or idea being challenged |
| message | Yes | Core message or desired outcome |
| resources | No | Available people, time, budget constraints |
| risk_tolerance | No | Low/medium/high - affects tactical suggestions |
| context | No | Current news cycle, relevant events, timing considerations |

---

## The Seven-Step Image Bomb Methodology

### Step 1: Identify the Target

Name the specific institution, policy, or idea you're challenging. The more specific, the more effective.

**Good targets:**
- A specific corporation's policy
- A particular law or proposed legislation
- An identifiable symbol of the problem

**Weak targets:**
- Abstract concepts ("inequality")
- Vague institutions ("the system")

### Step 2: Find the Symbol

Identify the visual symbol that represents the target. The symbol must be:
- Instantly recognizable
- Associated with the target in public consciousness
- Capable of being disrupted or recontextualized

**Examples:**
- Stock exchange floor = capitalism
- Pentagon = military establishment
- Dollar bills = monetary system/greed

### Step 3: Design the Disruption

Create the visual action that will be impossible to ignore. The disruption should:
- Create a striking, photographable moment
- Be simple enough to execute reliably
- Communicate the message without explanation

**The Hoffman Formula:** Take the symbol and do something to it that reveals its true nature or absurdity.

- NYSE + throwing money = exposing the naked greed
- Pentagon + attempt to levitate = exposing the absurdity of war machine
- Political convention + nominating a pig = exposing the circus

### Step 4: Anticipate Counterframes

How will opponents try to frame your action? Plan for:
- "Childish prank" dismissal
- "Dangerous extremist" attack
- "Out of touch" criticism

### Step 5: Pre-Frame the Action

Get ahead of counterframes by:
- Preparing soundbites that explain the message
- Having credible spokespeople ready
- Creating supporting materials that contextualize the action

### Step 6: Execute with Commitment

The action must be performed with complete conviction. Half-hearted execution kills the image.

**Key principles:**
- Everyone involved must understand the message
- Backup plans for likely obstacles
- Document everything (your footage, not just media footage)

### Step 7: Let the Image Speak

After the action, resist the urge to over-explain. The image bomb works because it's:
- Visual (transcends language barriers)
- Emotional (bypasses rational defenses)
- Repeatable (media will show it again and again)

**Your job after:** Provide brief, quotable context, not lectures.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Image Bomb Design: [Target Name]

### Target Analysis
[Specific institution/policy/idea and why it deserves challenge]

### Symbol Identification
[Visual symbol that represents the target]

### The Action
[Detailed description of the visual disruption]

### Logistics
- **Location:** Where
- **Timing:** When (and why this timing)
- **People needed:** Who and how many
- **Materials:** What you need
- **Duration:** How long

### Pre-Frame Strategy
- **Soundbite:** One sentence that explains everything
- **Spokesperson:** Who speaks and why
- **Supporting materials:** What to prepare

### Counterframe Defense
| Likely Attack | Prepared Response |
|---------------|-------------------|
| [Attack 1] | [Response] |
| [Attack 2] | [Response] |

### Success Metrics
[How you'll know if it worked]

### Risk Assessment
[What could go wrong and mitigation strategies]
```

## Constraints

- Never suggest actions that could cause physical harm
- Never target individuals personally—target institutions and ideas
- The action must be legally defensible or clearly civil disobedience with informed consent
- Must have genuine message, not just disruption for its own sake
- If violence or property destruction is core to the idea, reject and redesign

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "We need media attention for climate change. The local power company just announced they're expanding coal operations. No budget, ten volunteers."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Image Bomb Design: Coal Plant Expansion

### Target Analysis
Regional Power Co.'s expansion of coal operations despite climate crisis. Specific, local, photographable.

### Symbol Identification
The coal plant's smokestacks—visible, iconic, directly connected to emissions.

### The Action
"Funeral for the Future": Ten volunteers in formal funeral attire carry a child-sized coffin to the plant entrance. The coffin is labeled "2050." They hold a solemn, silent vigil.

The image: Mourners in black standing before belching smokestacks, grieving a future that hasn't happened yet.

### Logistics
- **Location:** Main entrance to Regional Power Co. facility
- **Timing:** 7am shift change (maximum employee witnesses), midweek (slower news day = more coverage appetite)
- **People needed:** 10 volunteers plus 2 documenting
- **Materials:** Formal black clothes, small symbolic coffin, "2050" label, flowers
- **Duration:** 30-60 minutes

### Pre-Frame Strategy
- **Soundbite:** "We're mourning the future Regional Power Co. is stealing from our children."
- **Spokesperson:** Parent with young child (credibility, emotion)
- **Supporting materials:** Fact sheet on expansion's emissions impact, children's drawings of "my future"

### Counterframe Defense
| Likely Attack | Prepared Response |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "Theatrical stunt" | "What's theatrical is pretending coal expansion won't kill our children." |
| "They're extremists" | "We're parents. We're mourning. That's not extreme—it's human." |
| "Jobs matter" | "Jobs won't matter on a dead planet. We want clean energy jobs here." |

### Success Metrics
- Local TV coverage (goal: all 3 stations)
- Photo in regional newspaper
- Social media shares >1000
- Power company issues response (means they noticed)

### Risk Assessment
- **Arrest:** Low risk if on public property; have legal observers
- **Weather:** Backup date scheduled
- **Low turnout:** Minimum 6 people can still execute; recruit backups

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Abbie Hoffman** expert persona. Hoffman understood that in media-saturated society, the image IS the message. "A modern revolutionary group heads for the television station, not the train station." The image bomb bypasses gatekeepers by creating visuals too compelling for media to ignore.
